# C# Mini Projects

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a collection of **practical C# projects** developed as part of a **university-level C# programming course**.

The main goal of the course was not only to learn the syntax of C#, but to apply it in **real-world–inspired scenarios**, focusing on:

- file system operations
- data processing
- performance considerations
- clean project structure
- analytical thinking

Each subfolder represents a **separate, self-contained project**, gradually increasing in complexity.

## ⭐ Highlighted Project

## 🚲 1. NYC Bike Rentals — Data Analysis Project

This is the **most advanced and complete project** in the repository and serves as the best example of applied C# skills.

The application analyzes **nearly 10 million Citi Bike rental records from New York City (2015)** and combines them with **weather data** to extract meaningful insights.

### Key features:

- large-scale CSV data processing
- time-based and seasonal analysis
- comparison of different user groups
- operational insights (bike rebalancing)
- anomaly detection in real-world data
- performance measurement of each analytical module

### Example insights:

- clear commuting patterns during rush hours
- strong dependency between weather and bike usage
- differences between tourists and city residents
- identification of stations requiring bike redistribution
- detection of unrealistic trips caused by data inconsistencies

📂 **This project is highly recommended to explore first**, especially for people interested in data processing, backend logic, and analytical reasoning in C#.

## 📁 Other Projects

## 📄 3. Duplicate PDF and MD Files

A smaller utility-style console application focused on **file system analysis**.

### What it does:

- scans a directory for files with the same name
- detects `.pdf` + `.md` duplicates
- displays results in the console
- removes `.pdf` files after user confirmation

This project demonstrates:

- directory traversal
- safe file deletion
- user interaction via console

➡️ See: `3. Duplicate PDF and MD Files/`

## 👀 4. Directory Watcher

A project focused on **real-time file system monitoring** using C#.

### Features include:

- watching directories and subdirectories for changes
- reacting to file creation, deletion, and renaming
- automatic file sorting based on extension
- live statistics of file types
- logging operations to a text file

This project demonstrates:

- FileSystemWatcher usage
- event-driven programming
- automated file organization

➡️ See: `4. Directory watcher/`
